# Introduction
This script saves profiles for your main + alt (individual in-game settings, auto login to both accounts by not having to use an incognito browser for your alt.)

# Installation
* Install python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Open a terminal/shell in the ezflyff folder and run the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running program
* Open a terminal/shell in the ezflyff folder and run the command: `python main.py`
* * Check the window's title to see which profile it's using.
* * * Log into the appropriate account for each window.
* * * Close the windows and then rerun the script. It should log into each automatically (you only need to do this once.)
